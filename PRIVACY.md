# CleanShot Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 4, 2026

---

## Overview

CleanShot is a photo organization app built by Aravindh S. This policy explains how we handle your data.

---

## Data Philosophy

**Your photos stay on your device. Always.**

CleanShot processes everything locally on your phone. We do not upload, collect, store, or share any of your photos or data with any third parties.

---

## What CleanShot Does

CleanShot helps you identify clutter in your photo library:
- **Screenshots** — Photos matching screenshot patterns
- **Duplicates** — Identical or near-identical photos
- **Blurry Photos** — Photos with low quality metrics
- **Old Photos** — Photos older than your threshold

All analysis happens on-device using Apple's Photos framework and Expo's MediaLibrary API.

## Permissions We Request

| Permission | Why We Need It |
|------------|----------------|
| **Photo Library Access** | To scan and analyze your photos |
| **Delete Photos** | To remove selected photos (only when you tap delete) |

We only access photos when you tap "Scan for Clutter."
